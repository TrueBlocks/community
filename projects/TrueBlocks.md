## Project Name 
Unchained Index by TrueBlocks

## Category 
Infrastructure, Public Good

## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
 Unchained Index facilitates easy and cheap access to immutable blockchain data. It is an index tool which provides a unique approach to distributing chain data via a smart contract and IPFS. Unlike most index providers, Unchained Index seeks to reduce dependency on a central gatekeeper, retain the immutable nature of the chain data and promote cheap and widespread data access. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
Unchained Index and IPFS are aligned philosophically as Unchained Index will leverage IPFS to broadly distribute chain data cheaply, securely, verifiably and decentrally. In early stages, we have used and will continue to use Pinata for pinning services.

## Project Status

 Unchained Index was conceived and partially developed at the ETHGlobal HackFS in August 2020. The project remains under development and is an intergral building block to our TrueBlocks account explorer application (for more on TrueBlocks see XYZ link)
