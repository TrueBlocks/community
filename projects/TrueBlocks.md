## Project Description
- TrueBlocks is an indexing solution for any blockchain, better explained [here](https://trueblocks.io/docs).
- Unchained Index is a set of ideas that are part of TrueBlocks that uses an Ethereum smart contract and IPFS to help us publish and share the index created by TrueBlocks in an web 3.0 native way.
- In this case, by "web 3.0 native" we mean in a way that is (a) reproducable, (b) uncapturable, (c) private by default, and (d) and most importantly, cheap.
- Using IPFS we've designed a way where our users naturally share the burden of carrying the index. Each user carrying his/her "fair share". This built in fairness facilitates, we think, adoption. Heavy users of the Ethereum chain will carry a heavier burden, ligher users will carry a lighter burden. This increases both long term viability of the indexing of each chain and makes the cost of the overall system approach zero while maintaining the immutable nature of the source blockchain data.
- Unlike most index providers, Unchained Index seeks to reduce dependency on a central gatekeeper, retain the immutable nature of the chain data and promote cheap and widespread data access. 

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
Unchained Index and IPFS are aligned philosophically as Unchained Index will leverage IPFS to broadly distribute chain data cheaply, securely, verifiably and decentrally. In early stages, we have used and will continue to use Pinata for pinning services.

## Project Status

 Unchained Index was conceived and partially developed at the ETHGlobal HackFS in August 2020. The project remains under development and is an intergral building block to our TrueBlocks account explorer application (for more on TrueBlocks see XYZ link)

## Target Audience

- Trueblocks and the Unchained Index are broadly applicable to many users. Being an indexing solution for blockchains in general, and the Ethereum mainnet in particular, anyone can use the data we produce. 
- Our primary audience is ultimately 'regular users', meaning individuals looking for fully-local access to blockchain data without reliance on any third party (including ourselves).

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)

- Being alpha software, we have no users in production but many interested potential users and active conversations in our Discord.
